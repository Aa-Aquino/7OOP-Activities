Hello! I'm Aaron Jan Aquino of class C204! 😃

## 🌟 About Me
I’m someone who can balance both being outgoing and introverted. I enjoy connecting with others when the situation calls for it, but I also value time alone to think deeply and recharge. I naturally approach challenges like a programmer debugging code, breaking problems down, analyzing them, and finding the most effective solution. Being a problem solver and solution provider is at the core of who I am; I don’t just look for quick fixes, I look for sustainable answers.
